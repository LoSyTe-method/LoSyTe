### Our Works
The complexity of circuit design continues to increase. It becomes particularly crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of logic synthesis tools. These tools efficiently convert hardware description languages into optimized gate-level netlists. However, inherent faults may cause failures in the synthesis process, which affects the accuracy of the generated netlists. In traditional approaches, the testing of logic synthesis tools has predominantly depended on code generators for test-program generation. However, the success of these methods is significantly influenced by the suitability of generator configurations. For an effective test configuration, it must produce test programs that are both bug-revealing (i.e., capable of triggering bugs) and diverse (i.e., ensuring the detection of various bug types). To achieve this goal, we propose LoSyTe: Logic Synthesis Tools Testing via Configuration Diversification with Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit. LoSyTe conducts comprehensive testing of logic synthesis tools through dynamic optimization of test-program generator configurations. It consists of three main components. Configuration selection component applies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select and optimize configuration combinations based on test feedback. Test-program vectorization component turns test-programs into feature vectors to quantify test diversity. Equivalence checking component checks the consistency of synthesized netlists with Verilog tests, to identify synthesis faults and guide strategy adjustments. We assess LoSyTe on both proprietary commercial logic synthesis tools (i.e., Vivado)  and open-source logic synthesis tools (i.e., Yosys). The results show that LoSyTe successfully discovered 20 bugs of 4 types; all the reported bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

### Main File
Our methodology is located in the 'method' directory:

The **"LoSyTe_method"** directory features our proposed LoSyTe algorithm's implementation, which includes:

1. **LoSyTe.py**: The main function and the first component (Configuration selection component) for dynamic parameter configuration acquisition.
2. **get_reward.py**: Evaluates each round's parameter configuration, incorporating the second (Test-program vectorization component) and third components (Equivalence checking component).
3. **get_feature.py**: Calculates feature vectors for each test program. We have constructed the following five categories of features:
    - Data processing and operations
    - Data flow control and representation
    - Structuring and modularization
    - Control flow and logic
    - Abstraction and reuse
4. **get_faults_number.py**: Counts the number of faults discovered in the test programs generated each round.
5. **config.toml** and **config_update.py**: `config.toml` is the parameter configuration file, while `config_update.py` updates this file with the latest parameter configuration combinations after each round.


2.The "Baseline" folder:

Contains the implementation of the five comparison algorithms used in this study: Default, Swarm, HIS, RECORD, and MCS.

3.The "Faults" folder:

Includes the defects discovered in the Vivado and Yosys logic synthesis tools. Each error file comes with a fault_description.pdf detailing the conditions that trigger the fault and an explanation of the error.
